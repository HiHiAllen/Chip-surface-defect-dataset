# Chip-surface-defect-dataset
This is a large Chip-surface-defect-dataset, with 2270 real non-defective samples, 1241 real defective samples, and 7250 synthetic defective samples.
# Update
The Git LFS quota is full, so I re-uploaded the dataset to Google Drive. Here is the link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_L7ovWgIBD15Tr5GqzKLJlNCYMVCJvBB/view?usp=drive_link
